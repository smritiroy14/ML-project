Analysis and Classification of mushrooms
Here I will explore the data presented by "UCI Machine Learning" for mushroom classification. The goal of this dataset is to classify between edible (e) to poisonous (p) mushrooms. First, I will analyze the data, by showing it's characteristics, and then I will classify it to achieve maximum accuracy and precision.
Apply  classifier to solve the Mushroom problem defined at https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification (Links to an external site.). Evaluate results using 10-fold cross-validation and report your findings.
Compare test set accuracy when training a mushroom classifier using 500 vs. 5,000 training examples.
Report accuracy on training and test data when using a decision tree that has 10 vs 30 leaves.
Report attribute tests used in the decision tree with 10 leaves.
For a decision tree with 10 leaves report the number of positive and negative training examples at each internal node and at leaves.
